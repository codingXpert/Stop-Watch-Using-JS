# StopWatch
An ultra-simple `HTML` + `CSS` + `JavaScript` Stopwatch

# Technology Used
**_1.HTML_**
**_2.CSS_** <br />
**_3.JavaScript_** <br />
## Why?

Helping people learn how to code requires a *simple* but *functional* example.


**_Everyone_** has experience using a stopwatch.
Whether to time an experiment in school (science class),
cooking in the home or holding ones' breath under water,
we can all *immediately* see the *use* of a stopwatch.

## How?
Open the **index.html** in your web browser and try the **_simple_ stopwatch**.
Then read the code in the files to understand how it all works!


### Interface
I tried to simplify the UI as much as possible so there is four button/control for the stopwatch: **START**
**PAUSE** **RESET**


When the "START" button is pressed/clicked it starts the timer.  
When the "STOP" button is pressed/clicked it stops the timer.  
When the "RESET" button is pressed/clicked it reset the timer.
